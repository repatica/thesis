This chapter will go away and it will be clear what the notation is in the introduction. This is just an intermediate step for me...


\begin{itemize}
 \item[d] $T$ and $T'$ or $T_1$ and $T_2$ for two trees. Don't do mathcal
 \item[d] $h(T,T')$ hybridization number of two trees
 \item $X$ set of taxa
 \item $\cL(T)$ set of leaves of $T$
 \item $\cF$ and other letters for forests of all kind. Capitals for components of forests.
 \item[d] $N$ or $H$ for networks. Don't do mathcal
 \item indegree $k$ and outdegree $k$. Don't do indegree-$k$ or in-degree $k$.
